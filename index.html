                    <p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in 1967,
                        the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the
                        greatest albums of all time. The album features Jimi Hendrix’s innovative approach to
                        songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic
                        and hard rock music.</p>

                        delayed the release until the following month. The album reached the top ten in the album charts

                    <p>Axis: Bold as Love’s scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape
                        of
                        side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming,
                        Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight
                        session.</p>
